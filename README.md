# PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR PREDICITVE MODELING OF TB DIAGNOSIS USING LUMINEX DATA <br />

•	Aim: This study investigates the ability of six ML algorithms to distinguish pulmonary TB in patients who presented having TB symptoms at primary healthcare clinics in six African countries. It further aims to assess the performance of these algorithms to determine which performs best.  <br />
•	Method: This suggested method assessed classification performances of sparseLDA, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), C5.0, elastic-net logistic regression, and random forest. All statistical analyses were performed using R (ver. 4.2.1) and the Tidymodels machine learning framework, working in RStudio running on Windows. The doParallel package made it easier to perform parallel processing  <br />
•	Performance Measurement: area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), Sensitivity and Specificity

The code runs for approximately 3.5-4 hours and an additional space of 2GB is needed. A cluster type “FORK” can be registered for Linux systems operating parallel processing.
