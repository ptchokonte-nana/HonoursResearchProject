# Performace evaluation of various machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling of TB diagnosis using Luminex data <br />

•	Aim: Evaluate a diverse variety of algorithms to determine which performs best <br />
•	Method: Utilize R with the Tidymodel machine learning framework, using data collected in a clinical study <br />
•	Performance: The performance of each algorithm will then be assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
